## How to be precise?

- The most important thing is to think like the computer: reason through your plan/pseudocode/code one step at a time, applying one simple instruction and then the next... there is a time and place to think abstractly, but when you're dealing with 10-20 lines of algorithm implementation you need to be concrete. I think of this as "using your brain-computer". Step through code in your head, one statement at a time. Ask yourself, what does this do, then what does this do, then what does this do... don't zoom out, don't squint, iterate like a computer would
- Write up tables where the columns are variables and the rows are iterations or function calls. Like, on the first loop, i = 0, n = 4 or whatever, then on the next loop, i = 1, n = 8 or whatever. Go one row at a time, don't skip rows
- It might help to think about invariants. I talk about this a little in Correct binary search (18:41) 
- Do more with pencil and paper
- Spend more time thinking, less time writing
- Before you run anything, ask yourself what exactly you expect to see, with as much precision as you can think of. If anything doesn't match your expectation, consider why
When you get something wrong, don't just think about how to fix it, also ask yourself why you got it wrong. What part did you rush through, neglect, misunderstand etc?
Finally, there's a kind of Culture of Precision that you need to decide to join, if not perpetually then at least in certain situations... like, maybe you imagine putting on your lab coat or something when you sit down. It's a weird thing to say, but if you're part of the Culture of Good Enough then you'll keep making mistakes no matter what else you try
